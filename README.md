# SaTT Wallet 🚀💼

Welcome to SaTT Wallet, a cutting-edge project in the realm of smart advertising. Our wallet leverages blockchain technology to offer a unique approach to managing and transacting with the Smart Advertising Transaction Token (SaTT). 🌐💰

## Project Overview 📚

Our project is composed of two main repositories:

1. **Backend** 🖥️: This part of the project provides the webservice for the SaTT Token WebWallet and the advertising campaign manager. It's primarily written in JavaScript.

2. **Frontend** 🎨: The frontend of the SaTT wallet is built using Angular, a robust framework in the TypeScript ecosystem.

## How to Contribute 💪🔧

We welcome developers who are passionate about decentralized technology, advertising, and improving user experience.

To contribute:

1. Fork the repository you wish to contribute to (Backend or Frontend). 🍴
2. Create a new branch for your feature. 🌿
3. Make your changes and commit them with clear, concise messages. 📝
4. Push your changes to your branch. 🚀
5. Create a pull request. 🙏

We strongly encourage contributors to adhere to best coding practices, which include:

- Write clean, readable, and maintainable code. 🧹✨
- Use meaningful naming for variables, functions, classes, and modules. 🏷️
- Comment your code where necessary but strive to make your code as self-explanatory as possible. 🗂️
- Avoid large commits that make the code review process more difficult. Break your work into small, individual commits each with a specific purpose. 🧩
- Update and write tests when contributing to code. 🧪
