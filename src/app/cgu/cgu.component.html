      who register on or after March 27, 2018.
    </p>
    <h1 class="DISCLAIMER">DISCLAIMER</h1>
    <p class="text-justify">
      By using the website and services offered by <strong>ATAYEN, Inc</strong>.
      the user acknowledges the risks involved in making purchases on the
      crypto-asset market. Crypto-asset markets are decentralized and
      unregulated. The services delivered by <strong>ATAYEN, Inc</strong>. and
      in particular the <strong>SaTT wallet</strong>, therefore relate to
      unregulated markets that are not governed by any specific European
      regulatory framework. As a result, the client is aware that, when
      operating on such markets, he does not benefit from the protections
      offered to users of regulated financial services. In the state of the
      current French regulations, <strong>ATAYEN, Inc</strong>. draws the
      attention of users to the following risks relating to the acquisition and
      sale of crypto-assets:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        A crypto-asset is not a "currency " in the sense of article l. 111-1 of
        the monetary and financial code. Only the euro (â‚¬) is the legal currency
        in France.
      </li>
      <li>
        Crypto-assets cannot be qualified as "electronic money " within the
        meaning of Article l. 315-1 of the Monetary and Financial Code;
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>ATAYEN, Inc. does</strong> not guarantee the legal qualification
        or price of crypto-assets;
      </li>
      <li>
        More generally, a crypto-asset cannot be considered a financial
        instrument. As such, users do not benefit from the protection offered by
        the protective provisions of the mif ii directive as transposed into
        French law.
      </li>
      <li>
        The user understands and agrees that the service involves assets with a
        high level of risk, not suitable for many buyers.
        <strong>ATAYEN, Inc</strong>. cannot explain all risks or how those
        risks apply to your particular circumstances. If you are unsure, you
        should contact a professional. It is important to fully understand the
        risks involved before deciding to purchase crypto assets. The client
        acknowledges that he/she fully understands the risks before deciding to
        purchase crypto-assets and must have sufficient financial resources to
        bear these risks. Buying in the crypto-asset market, of any kind,
        presents a risk to your capital. You should not buy with the money you
        cannot afford to lose.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h1 class="section1">1. DEFINITION</h1>
    <p class="text-justify">
      Blockchain refers to a complete list of all completed transaction blocks
      since the beginning of Bitcoin To enhance the security of the system, the
      blockchain was designed so that each block of transactions contains the
      hash generated from the previous block. The Blockchain is a technology for
      storing and transmitting information at minimal cost, secure, transparent,
      and operating without a central controlling body. By extension, the
      Blockchain designates a secure and distributed database (because it is
      shared by its various users), containing a set of transactions whose
      validity can be verified by anyone. The Blockchain can therefore be
      compared to a public, anonymous, and unfalsifiable accounting ledger.
    </p>

    <p class="text-justify">
      "Crypto-assets "refers to a set of assets related to the Blockchain such
      as: crypto-currencies, tokens, etc
    </p>

    <p class="text-justify">
      "Exchange "refers to a marketplace where crypto-assets are exchanged with
      each other or against fiat currencies. This allows you to invest or
      speculate on the price of crypto-assets (e.g. Binance, Gate.io, Bittrex,
      etc.).
    </p>

    <p class="text-justify">
      Hold, Holding"refers to the fact of keeping a crypto-asset and not selling
      it no matter what the price changes (up/down)
    </p>

    <p class="text-justify">
      KYC"means the process of verifying the identity of a company's users to
      ensure customer compliance with legislation relating to anti-corruption,
      money laundering, financial fraud, terrorist financing, etc.
    </p>

    <p class="text-justify">
      "Token / Tokens"refers to the uniquely issued assets for each
      crypto-currency or project, For example, Ethers are the Tokens of the
      Ethereum network.

      exchanged on the various Exchanges that exist. As a general rule, the
      underlying protocols are open source and, therefore, anyone can use, copy,
      modify and distribute them. The said protocols may be subject to sudden
      changes in the rules of operation ("Forks") and these Forks may impact the
      value, function, and even the name of the crypto asset. The User,
      therefore, understands that the information delivered by the Site and the
      Services offered by
      <strong>ATAYEN, Inc</strong>. cannot predict Forks and their impact on the
      value of cryptocurrencies.

      displayed to you on the <strong>ATAYEN</strong> website prior to each
      transaction and will be indicated in each receipt we send you. These
